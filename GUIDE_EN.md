## Introduction

### What is Fonetizer?

Fonetizer is a tool that converts English song lyrics into **phonetic tables** – perfectly tailored for barbershop singing. The tool helps you and your quartet sing with better:

- **Vowel unity**: All voices sing the same vowel sound simultaneously
- **Legato**: Smooth transitions between notes
- **Consistency**: Same pronunciation choices across the entire quartet
- **Precision**: Clear separation between consonants and vowels

### Why phonetic tables?

In barbershop, it's crucial that all four voices sing *exactly* the same vowel sounds simultaneously. When we read regular text, we often guess how words should be pronounced, and different people make different choices. A phonetic table eliminates the guesswork!

**Example:** The word "night" can be sung as "na-it" or "na-eet" depending on dialect. With Fonetizer, everyone sees the same phonetic breakdown and sings identically.

### Who is this for?

- Barbershop quartets looking to improve their precision
- Directors and coaches working on pronunciation training
- Singers who want to understand vowel-consonant structure in English lyrics

```

**Without measure numbers:**
```
There's a party tonight everyone is coming,
the music is high all the folks
enjoyin' and dancing the night away.
```

💡 **Tip:** Measure numbers are optional but help you find the right spot in the music!

## Understanding the Table

### Table Structure

When you open your Excel file, you'll see something like this:

```
Syllable ↓ | T1  |     | T3  |     | T5  |     |
-----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
1          | ð   | ɛːr | z   | ə   | pɑː | r   |
2          | t   | iː  | p   | ɑː  | t   | iː  |
3          |     | iː  | n   | aɪ  |     |     |
4          |     | ɪ   | t   |     |     |     |
```

### What do the columns mean?

- **Syllable ↓**: Row number (each row = one syllable to sing)
- **T1, T3, T5**: Measure numbers where the phrase begins
- **Each phrase = TWO COLUMNS:**
  - **Left column** (right-aligned): Consonants
  - **Right column** (left-aligned): Vowels

### How do I read the table?

**Each row is read from left to right:**

1. **Consonant** (left column) → pronounced quickly before the note
2. **Vowel** (right column) → THIS IS WHAT YOU SING! The vowel carries the tone.

**Example from "There's a party":**

| Consonant | Vowel |
|-----------|-------|
| ð         | ɛːr   |
| z         | ə     |
| pɑː       | r     |
| t         | iː    |

**How do I sing this?**

- Row 1: [ð] + [ɛːr] = "ther-" (the vowel ɛːr carries the note)
- Row 2: [z] + [ə] = "-sə" (short vowel)
- Row 3: [pɑː] + [r] = "par-"
- Row 4: [t] + [iː] = "-ty"

→ Result: "There's a party" 🎉

### Why two columns per phrase?

In barbershop, we want the **vowel to carry the note** for as long as possible. By separating consonants and vowels, you clearly see:
- Which sounds should be short (consonants)
- Which sounds should be sung out (vowels)

This creates **legato** – smooth, connected tones.

### Diphthongs (double vowels)

Some words have **diphthongs** – two vowel sounds in the same syllable. Example: "night" = [naɪ].

Fonetizer splits these onto **separate rows**:

| Consonant | Vowel |
|-----------|-------|
| n         | aː    |
|           | ɪ     |

This means:
1. Sing [aː] (as in "car") on the main note
2. Then glide to [ɪ] (as in "bit") at the end

By having them on separate rows, you can clearly see when the transition should happen!

### Phonetic Symbols (IPA)

The table uses **IPA** (International Phonetic Alphabet). Here are common symbols:

**Vowels:**
- `iː` = "ee" as in "see"
- `ɑː` = "ah" as in "car"
- `ɛ` = "eh" as in "bed"
- `ʊ` = "oo" as in "book"
- `ə` = schwa (like "uh")

**Consonants:**
- `ð` = "th" as in "the" (soft)
- `θ` = "th" as in "think" (hard)
- `ʃ` = "sh" as in "show"
- `ŋ` = "ng" as in "sing"
- `ʤ` = "j" as in "jump"

💡 **Tip:** You don't need to memorize them all! After a few rehearsals, you'll start recognizing the symbols.

## For Singers

### During Rehearsals

**1. Preparation (at home):**
- Download the table for your upcoming song
- Open in Excel/Sheets on your phone/computer
- Read through the columns for your part
- Practice pronouncing the vowels cleanly

**2. In rehearsal:**
- Have the table ready (phone/paper)
- Everyone looks at the same column simultaneously
- Sing slowly, row by row
- Focus on EVERYONE singing the same vowel sound

**3. Vowel Training:**
- Sing only the vowel column (right column)
- Sustain each vowel for a long time
- Listen to how the quartet sounds – do all four sound alike?
- Adjust together until you have the same vowel sound

### Tips for Better Results

**Legato:**
- Consonants should be **short and clear**
- Vowels should **carry the note**
- Transitions between vowels should be **smooth**

**Vowel Unity:**
- Sing only vowels first (without consonants)
- Sustain each vowel for 4 beats
- Listen: Do all four parts sound like ONE vowel?
- If not – adjust mouth/jaw until it matches

**Consistency:**
- Decide as a quartet: How should we pronounce this word?
- The table gives you a suggestion – but you can adapt!
- Note your choices directly in the Excel file

### Example: Practice "night away"

From the table:

| Consonant | Vowel |
|-----------|-------|
| n         | aː    |
|           | ɪ     |
| t         |       |
| ə         |       |
| w         | eː    |
|           | ɪ     |

**Exercise:**
1. Sing only the vowels: "aː - ɪ - eː - ɪ"
2. Sustain each vowel for 4 beats
3. Listen to the balance
4. Add the consonants: "n-aː-ɪ-t-ə-w-eː-ɪ"
5. Sing in tempo

### On Stage

Once you know the song, you won't need the table anymore – your body remembers! But keep it handy for:
- Troubleshooting during rehearsals
- Learning new songs quickly
- Discussions about pronunciation choices

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I handle lines without measure numbers?

No problem! Fonetizer accepts text **both with and without measure numbers**:

**With measure numbers:**
```
1 There's a party tonight
```

**Without measure numbers:**
```
There's a party tonight
```

If you skip measure numbers, the column headers will be empty – but the table still works!

### Why do some words turn out different than I expected?

Fonetizer uses **standard pronunciation** (American English). If your quartet sings in a different dialect or style, you can:
- Edit the table directly in Excel
- Change vowels to what you prefer
- Save your own version

The table is a starting point – not a law! 😊

### Can I use Swedish lyrics?

Unfortunately not yet. Fonetizer is currently built for **English lyrics** because it uses English pronunciation rules and phonetic symbols. Swedish is planned for the future!

### What happens with words like "gonna", "wanna", etc.?

Fonetizer handles informal language:
- "gonna" → [gɑːnə]
- "wanna" → [wɑːnə]
- "gotta" → [gɑːtə]

Write the word as it appears in the lyrics/score!

### How do I handle repetitions?

If the same word is sung in multiple places:
- Paste all lines in the input
- Use measure numbers to distinguish them
- You'll get one column for each phrase

Example:
```
1 I love you
5 I love you
9 I love you again
```

Gives three separate columns: T1, T5, T9.

### Can I share my table with others?

Absolutely! The Excel file is entirely yours. You can:
- Share via email
- Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
- Print to paper
- Edit and customize

### Does the app work on mobile?

Yes! Fonetizer is optimized for both mobile and desktop. However, the best experience is on a larger screen where you can comfortably edit the Excel file.

### Why do some vowels appear on their own row without a consonant?

Those are **diphthongs** – double vowel sounds! Example: "night" = [aɪ].

- First vowel: The main sound you sing
- Second vowel: The glide sound at the end

By having them on separate rows, you can clearly see where the transition should occur.

### Can I edit the table after it's generated?

Absolutely! The Excel file is fully editable. You can:
- Add colors for different voice parts
- Change vowel symbols if you pronounce differently
- Add notes
- Delete/add rows

### How often should I generate new tables?

Every time you learn a new song! Create one table per:
- Verse
- Chorus
- Bridge
- Intro/outro

Name the files clearly so you know what's what.

## Technical Details

*For those who want to dig deeper!*

### IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)

Fonetizer uses IPA notation to represent sounds. IPA is an internationally standardized system where each symbol corresponds to **exactly one sound** – regardless of language.

**Advantages:**
- Unambiguous: "a" can be pronounced 10 different ways, but "ɑː" always means the same thing
- International: Works regardless of native language
- Precise: Perfect for vocal training

### How does Fonetizer work?

1. **Input:** You enter text
2. **Parsing:** The tool breaks text into phrases and words
3. **Phonetic conversion:** Uses CMU Pronouncing Dictionary for American English pronunciation
4. **Syllable division:** Splits words into consonants and vowels
5. **Table generation:** Creates Excel file with your columns

### Diphthong Handling

Fonetizer splits diphthongs according to the principle:

**Diphthong = Long vowel + Glide**

Examples:
- "cry" = [aɪ] → [aː] + [ɪ]
- "know" = [oʊ] → [oː] + [ʊ]
- "way" = [eɪ] → [eː] + [ɪ]

This allows you to sing out the main vowel and glide smoothly to the glide sound.

### Consonant Clusters

When multiple consonants appear together (e.g., "str" in "string"), Fonetizer places them in the **same cell** without spaces:

| Consonant | Vowel |
|-----------|-------|
| str       | ɪ     |

This shows that all three consonants should be pronounced quickly before the vowel.

### Syllable Boundaries

Fonetizer moves consonants forward to the next syllable when possible:

**Example:** "party"
- Not: "par-ty" → [pɑːr] + [tiː]
- But: "par-ty" → [pɑː] + [rtiː]

This creates better legato because the vowel in the first syllable ends the syllable.
